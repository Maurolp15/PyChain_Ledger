## PyChain Ledger

My name is Oscar Lopez, I’m a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp Program.

In this activity, I was tasked with building a blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly web interface, the ledger should allow partners banks to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger. 

I created a new data class which serves as a blueprint for the financial records that the blocks will store in the ledger, then I modified the existing block given to us in the started code to store the one I created. I added the relevant user inputs to the Streamlit interface, then I tested the Pychain ledger by storing records.
